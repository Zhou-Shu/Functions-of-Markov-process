# Functions-of-Markov-process

- Some of the functions that are commonly used by me in the markov process, which contents limit law (stationary, occupation law), mean occupation time, hitting time, transient probability and cost model of Markov process or Markov chain.


- Functions has no comments because the output value is the same as the function name I chose.
